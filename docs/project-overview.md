# 📘 Project Overview

**The AI-Peeragogical Agent** is not just a tool.  
It’s a collective invitation to experiment with how artificial intelligence can support and co-create peer learning experiences.

This repository acts as a **shared lab and launchpad** for ideas, projects, and practical implementations that apply AI — including generative agents — to the Peeragogy framework.

## 🌱 What We're Building

This space supports contributors who want to:

- Adapt content from the **Peeragogy Handbook** to different audiences using AI
- Design new **learning activities**, powered or co-created by AI agents
- Build interfaces (e.g. dashboards, assistants, plugins) that embody peeragogical principles
- Document these experiences as **case studies**, useful for others in the community

These contributions will form the foundation for a **modular, adaptive, and living V4 edition** of the Peeragogy Handbook — built collaboratively.

## 🎯 Our Goal

Enable the community to explore and propose:

- 🧠 AI-assisted rewrites of handbook chapters for different learner profiles
- 🤖 AI agents that guide, ask questions, and suggest group-based learning tasks
- 🛠️ Practical tools (apps, workflows, demos) that show how AI can *augment* peer learning — not automate it

> We are not replacing human collaboration.  
> We are enhancing it — with context-aware, participatory AI.

## 🧪 Who Can Participate?

- Educators designing AI-supported learning environments
- Developers creating tools or agents for collaborative learning
- Learners who want to re-shape content for their context
- Researchers and activists exploring ethical, inclusive, collective AI

## 🧭 How to Get Involved

- Use the [`proposal/template.md`](../proposal/template.md) to pitch your idea
- Browse and join existing proposals under [`proposal/submitted/`](../proposal/submitted/)
- Explore the [AI agent notes](ai-agent-notes.md) to understand the logic and potential
- Share your work in progress as a case study for the Handbook V4

## 🌀 What Kind of Projects Fit?

Here are some possible directions:

- A group of students adapts a chapter using ChatGPT and tests it in a workshop
- An educator creates an AI assistant that helps plan peer-led activities
- A developer builds a dashboard to visualize group contributions over time
- A community translates a chapter and uses AI to localize examples and tasks

> This repository is a **collaborative space for applied peeragogy with AI**.  
> Bring your experiments, your questions, your drafts — and grow them into shared knowledge.

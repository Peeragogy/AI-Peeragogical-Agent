## 🔄 Proposal Review Process

All new project ideas start in:  
📂 `/proposal/submitted/`

Each proposal is reviewed openly by the community (via issues, Discord, or comments).  
Once a project gains traction (e.g. initial activity, feedback, contributor interest), it can be moved to:  
📂 `/proposal/accepted/`

> This does not mean the project is “approved” by a central authority.  
> It simply signals that the idea is **active and supported** by contributors.

Community members are welcome to:
- Comment on proposals
- Express interest or co-contribute
- Help shape and evolve the scope

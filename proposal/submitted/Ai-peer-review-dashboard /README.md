## 📌 Title of Your Project

Peeragogy Peer Review Dashboard

---

## 🧭 Summary (2–3 sentences)

This dashboard is an experimental project designed to support collaborative review of chapters from the *Peeragogy Handbook*.  
It offers an interface where users can read chapters, receive AI-generated feedback, and vote on suggestions — making the review process more dynamic and accessible.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To develop a tool that facilitates transparent, community-driven improvement of handbook content, and that can evolve into a semi-automated peer review assistant.

---

## 🔍 Context

The *Peeragogy Handbook* is an open, evolving resource.  
Reviewing and improving it collaboratively can be challenging without a shared interface.  
This dashboard offers a first step toward collective curation, versioning, and open review — aligned with peeragogical values.

---

## 🤖 Use of AI

Currently, an AI Reviewer can generate suggestions for improving chapter content.  
In the future, the AI could:
- Prioritize chapters based on feedback volume  
- Offer rewrite variants or paraphrasing  
- Highlight unclear or ambiguous sections  
- Support version comparison and summaries

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Peer Component

The dashboard enables group-based chapter review by allowing:
- Collective reading and annotation  
- Voting on suggestions  
- Visualizing revision history as a shared memory

Each reviewer becomes a co-editor in the knowledge-building process.

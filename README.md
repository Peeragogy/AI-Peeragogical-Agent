## 🧠 What is this project?

**AI-Peeragogical-Agent** is an open, evolving initiative exploring how artificial intelligence can support and enhance peer learning practices.  
It invites educators, developers, designers, and learners to co-create tools, content, and experiences inspired by the [Peeragogy Handbook](https://peeragogy.org/).

This is not just a software repo.  
It’s a collaborative learning environment, where ideas turn into prototypes, and prototypes into shared knowledge.

→ Propose your project. Fork the agent. Collaborate on the future of education.

# ðŸ§  Peeragogy AI Dashboard

This is the root of the `dashboard` branch for the Peeragogy AI-Peeragogical-Agent project.  
Here we build and test the front-end dashboard for peer review, feedback synthesis, and AI-powered learning.

## Structure

- `index.html` â€“ interactive wireframe
- `/assets/` â€“ CSS, JS, images
- `/chapters/` â€“ content from Peeragogy Handbook
- `/data/` â€“ feedback, summaries, resources
- `/docs/` â€“ technical docs

> Designed to be clean, modular, and ready for scale.

# Peeragogy Peer Review Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction

This dashboard is an experimental project aimed at facilitating the collaborative review of chapters in the *Peeragogy Handbook*. The goal is to create an interface that allows users to view chapters, receive AI-generated suggestions, and improve the review process.

> **Note:** This is not currently an AI Agent, but it could evolve into a useful tool in the future to automate the review process and assist reviewers in managing chapters.

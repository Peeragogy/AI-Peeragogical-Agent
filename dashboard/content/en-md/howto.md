This document is a practical guide to co-learning, a living document
that invites comment and invites readers to join the community of
editors. The document does not have to be read in linear order from
beginning to end. Material about conceptualizing and convening
co-learning -- the stuff that helps with getting started -- is located
toward the top of the table of contents. Material about use cases,
resources, and assessment is located toward the bottom. Hop around if
you'd like.

We've focused on "hands-on" techniques, and you'll probably want to try
things out with your own groups and networks as you read.

-   If you want a starter syllabus, check out “[Peeragogy in
    Action](http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-in-action/)” in the resources
    section.
-   If you want to delve directly into the research literature, our
    initial literature survey forms the basis of a [Wikipedia
    article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning), and the book
    also includes additional [recommended
    readings](http://peeragogy.org/recommended-reading/ "Recommended Reading").
-   For something lighter, many pages in the online version of the book
    include short introductory videos, most of them under one minute
    long. You can do a [search on
    YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=peeragogy&sm=3)
    to find these and many of our other videos all in one place.

(which also happens to have the name *Peeragogy in Action*). If you want
to test the waters first, feel free to use the comment thread attached
to each page on peeragogy.org to suggest any changes or additions, and
to share a bit about your story. We might quote you in future versions
of the book to help improve the resource for others, like this:
**John Glass**: Reading through the handbook, it strikes me that the
users will be fairly sophisticated folks. They will have ample knowledge
of various tech platforms, resources, a fair amount of formal education,
access and ability to use a number of different gadgets. My dilemma is
that I am thinking that Peeragogy, at its most basic, seems to be about
facilitating P2P learning. As such, at its most basic, it would be about
assisting people to work together to learn something (and for me,
learning encompasses virtually all human behavior, with the possible
exception of that controlled by the autonomic nervous system and even
there I am not sure). In other words, I am thinking it is about helping
anyone learn through partnership with others (group *A*) and yet the
handbook appears to be geared toward a rather specialized group of
people (group *B*). I guess what I am looking for is perhaps some
clarification on who is the intended audience, *A* or *B*? As it stands,
I am unsure how it could realistically apply to *A*...Thanks.

**Joe Corneli**: I think that the best thing to do is to do this in
dialog. In addition to groups *A* and *B*, we might need a group *C*,
who would mediate between the two. The assignment would be something
like this: "Use this to structure the class, and if you get stuck at any
point or if you think the resource isn't the right one, ask me for help,
and we'll work on finding other solutions together." At the end of the
semester, you might have a new and very different book tailored to this
particular "audience" (or "public" to use Howard's term)! That would be
cool. The current book definitely isn't a one-size-fits-all -- I'd say
it's more like a sewing machine. In fact, I think group *C* is the real
"public" for this book -- not experts, but people who will say: "How can
I use the ideas and the process here to do something new?" What people
do with it will definitely depend on the goal: the model might be *Stand
and Deliver* or it might be *Good Will Hunting* or it may be something
very different. Our long-term goal is not to build a 1000 page version
of the handbook, but to serve as a "hub" that can help many different
peer learning projects. The first question is: How can we improve the
usability for you? Rather than tackling the whole book all at once, I
would recommend that we start by dialoging about the “[Peeragogy in
Action](http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-in-action/ "Peeragogy in action")”
syllabus at the end. How would we have to tailor that to suit the needs
of your students? With that in mind, another useful starting point might
be our article on [the student authored
syllabus](http://peeragogy.org/the-student-authored-syllabus/ "The student authored syllabus").
Finally, our motto for the book is: “*This is a How-To Handbook*.” We
can talk more about anything that's confusing and get rid of or
massively revise anything that's not useful. That's a super-micro guide
to doing peeragogy.

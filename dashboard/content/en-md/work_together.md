## Metacognition and mindfulness in peer learning

Metacognition and mindfulness have to do with your awareness how how you
think, talk, participate, and attend to circumstances.

It can be particularly useful to apply this sort of "meta awareness" as
you think about the roles that you take on in a given project, the kind
of contributions you want to make, and what you hope to get out of the
experience. These are all likely to change as time passes, so it's good
to get in the habit of reflection.

### Potential roles in your peer-learning project

1.  Leader, Manager, Team Member, Worker
2.  Content Creator, Author, Content Processor, Reviewer, Editor
3.  Presentation Creator, Designer, Graphics, Applications
4.  Planner, Project Manager, Coordinator, Attendee, Participant
5.  Mediator, Moderator, Facilitator, Proponent, Advocate,
    Representative, Contributor

### Potential contributions

1.  Create, Originate, Research, Aggregate
2.  Develop, Design, Integrate, Refine, Convert
3.  Write, Edit, Format

### Potential motivations

1.  Acquisition of training or support in a topic or field;
2.  Building relationships with interesting people;
3.  Finding professional opportunities through other participants;
4.  Creating or bolstering a personal network;
5.  More organized and rational thinking through dialog and debate;
6.  Feedback about performance and understanding of the topic.

The process of shared reflection can prime a group for cohesion and
success. It can be tremendously useful to think about the motivations of
other participants, and how these can be jointly served. How can we
re-use the "side-effects" of individual and cooperative efforts in a
useful way?

### Two theories of motivation

One of the most prominent thinkers working in the field of
(self-)motivation is Daniel Pink [2], who proposes a theory of
motivation based on autonomy, mastery, and purpose, or, more colorfully:

1.  The urge to direct my life
2.  The desire to get better at something that matters
3.  The yearning to do something that serves a purpose bigger than just
    “myself”

There’s clearly a “learning orientation” behind the second point: it’s
not just a matter of “fun” — the sense of achievement matters. But fun
remains relevant. Thomas Malone [3] specifically asked “What makes
things fun to learn?” His proposed framework for building fun learning
activities is also based on the three ingredients: fantasy, challenge,
and curiosity.

We can easily see how “participation” relates to “motivation” as
described above. When I can get useful information from other people, I
can direct my own life better. When I have means of exploring my dreams
by chatting then over and exploring some of the elements in a safe way,
I’m in a much better position to make something in reality. A solid
reputation that comes from being able to help others serves as a good
indicator of personal progress, a sign that one is able to deal with
greater challenges. Relationships provide the most basic sense of being
part of something bigger than oneself: et cetera. We'll say more about
these matters in the chapters on
[Cooperation](http://peeragogy.org/cowork/ "Cooperation").

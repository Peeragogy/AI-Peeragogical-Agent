This section about organizing Co-Learning rests on the assumption that
learning always happens in a context, whether this context is a
structured "course" or a (potentially) less structured "learning space".
For the moment we consider the following division:

-   *Organizing Co-learning Contexts*
    -   Courses (= "learning linked to a timeline or syllabus")
    -   Spaces (= "learning not linked to a timeline or syllabus")

This section focuses on existing learning contexts and examines in
detail how they have been "organized" by their (co-)creators. At a
"meta-level" of media, we can talk about this parallel structure:
-   *Building Co-learning Platforms*
    -   Development trajectories (e.g. "design, implement, test,
        repeat")
    -   Platform features (e.g. forums, wikis, ownership models, etc.)

A given learning environment with have both time-like and space-like
features as well as both designed-for and un-planned features. A given
learning platform will encourage certain types of engagement and impose
certain constraints. The question for both "teachers" and "system
designers" -- as well as for learners -- should be: *what features best
support learning?*

The answer will depend on the learning task and available resources.
For example, nearly everyone agrees that the best way to learn a foreign
language is through immersion. But not everyone who wants to learn, say,
French, can afford to drop everything to go live in a French-speaking
country. Thus, the space-like full immersion "treatment" is frequently
sacrificed for course-like treatments (either via books, CDs, videos, or
ongoing participation in semi-immersive discussion groups).

System designers are also faced with scarce resources: programmer time,
software licensing concerns, availability of peer support, and so forth.
While the ideal platform would (magically) come with solutions
pre-built, a more realistic approach recognizes that problem solving
always takes time and energy. The problem solving approach and
associated "learning orientation" will also depend on the task and
resources at hand. The following sections will develop this issue
further through some specific case studies.

## Case study 1 (pilot, completed): "Paragogy" and the After Action
Review.

In our analysis of our experiences as course organizers at P2PU, we (Joe
Corneli and Charlie Danoff) used the US Army's technique of After Action
Review (AAR). To quote from [our
paper](http://paragogy.net/ParagogyPaper2) [2]:

> As the name indicates, the AAR is used to review training exercises.
> It is important to note that while one person typically plays the role
> of evaluator in such a review [...] the review itself happens among
> peers, and examines the operations of the unit as a whole.
>
> The four steps in an AAR are:
> 1.  Review what was supposed to happen (training plans).
> 2.  Establish what happened.
> 3.  Determine what was right or wrong with what happened.
> 4.  Determine how the task should be done differently the next time.
>
> The stated purpose of the AAR is to “identify strengths and
> shortcomings in unit planning, preparation, and execution, and guide
> leaders to accept responsibility for shortcomings and produce a fix.”

We combined the AAR with several principles (see Discussion section
below), which we felt described effective peer learning, and went
through steps 1-4 for each principle to look at how well it was
implemented at P2PU. This process helped generate a range of advice that
could be applied at P2PU or similar institutions. By presenteding our
paper at the [Open Knowledge Conference
(OKCon)](http://okfn.org/okcon/), we were able to meet P2PU's executive
director, Philipp Schmidt, as well as other highly-involved P2PU
participants; our feedback may have contributed to shaping the
development trajectory for P2PU.

In addition, we developed a strong prototype for constructive engagement
with peer learning that we and others could deploy again. In other
words, variants on the AAR and the paragogical principles could be
incorporated into future learning contexts as platform features [3] or
re-used in a design/administration/moderation approach [4]. For example,
we also used the AAR to help structure our writing and subsequent work
on [paragogy.net](http://paragogy.net).

## Case Study 2 (in progress): "Peeragogy".

Our particular focus in the interviews was on drawing out and
emphasizing the relational dimension of students, learning experiences
within their environment and, consequently, on inferring from their
accounts a sense of how they perceived and indeed constituted their
environment. We asked them who they learned with and from and how. A
further question specifically focused on whom they regarded as their
peers and how they understood their peers as a source and a site for
learning." [1]

In this section, we will interview and/or survey members of the
Peeragogy community with questions similar to those used by Boud and Lee
[1] and then identify strengths and shortcomings as we did with the AAR
above. These questions are derived from the AAR.

## Questions

These were discussed, refined, and answered on an etherpad: revisions to
the original set of questions are marked in italics.
1.  Who have you learned with or from in the Peeragogy project? *What
    are you doing to contribute to your peers' learning?*
2.  How have you been learning during the project?
3.  Who are your peers in this community, and why?
4.  What were your expectations of participation in this project? *And,
    specifically, what did you (or do you) hope to learn through
    participation in this project?*
5.  What actually happened during your participation in this project (so
    far)? *Have you been making progress on your learning goals (if any;
    see previous question) -- or learned anything unexpected, but
    interesting?*
6.  What is right or wrong with what happened (Alternatively: how would
    you assess the project to date?)
7.  How might the task be done differently next time? (What's "missing"
    here that would create a "next time"*, "sequel", or
    "continuation"?*)
8.  *How would you like to use the Peeragogy handbook?*
9.  *Finally, how might we change the questions, above, if we wanted to
    apply them in your peeragogical context?*

### **Reflections on participants' answers**

The questions were intended to help participants reflect on, and change,
their practice (i.e. their style of participation). There is a tension,
however, between changing midstream and learning what we might do
differently next time. There is a related tension between initial
structure and figuring things out as we go. Arguably, if we knew, 100%,
how to do peeragogy, then we would not learn very much in writing this
handbook. Difficulties and tensions would be resolved "in advance" (see
earlier comments about "magical" technologies for peer production).

And yet, despite our considerable collected expertise on collaboration,
learning, and teaching, there have been a variety of tensions here!
Perhaps we should judge our "success" partly on how well we deal with
those. Some of the tensions highlighted in the answers are as follows:

1.  *Slow formation of "peer" relationships.* There is a certain irony
    here: we are studying "peeragogy" and yet many respondents did not
    feel they were really getting to know one another "as peers", at
    least not yet. Those who did have a "team" or who knew one another
    from previous experiences, felt more peer-like in those
    relationships. Several remarked that they learned less from other
    individual participants and more from "the collective" or "from
    everyone". At the same time, some respondents had ambiguous feelings
    about naming individuals in the first question: "I felt like I was
    going to leave people out and that that means they would get a bad
    grade - ha!" One criterion for being a peer was to have built
    something together, so by this criterion, it stands to reason that
    we would only slowly become peers through this project.

2.  *"Co-learning", "co-teaching", "co-producing"?* One respondent
    wrote: "I am learning about peeragogy, but I think I'm failing [to
    be] a good peeragog. I remember that Howard [once] told us that the
    most important thing is that you should be responsible not only for
    your own learning but for your peers' learning. [...] So the
    question is, are we learning from others by ourselves or are we
    [...] helping others to learn?" Another wrote: "To my surprise I
    realized I could contribute organizationally with reviews, etc. And
    that I could provide some content around PLNs and group process.
    Trying to be a catalyst to a sense of forward movement and esprit de
    corps."

3.  *Weak structure at the outset, versus a more "flexible" approach.*
    One respondent wrote: "I definitely think I do better when presented
    with a framework or scaffold to use for participation or content
    development. [...] (But perhaps it is just that I'm used to the old
    way of doing things)." Yet, the same person wrote: "I am interested
    in [the] applicability [of pæragogy] to new models for
    entrepreneurship enabling less structured aggregation of
    participants in new undertakings, freed of the requirement or need
    for an entrepreneurial visionary/source/point person/proprietor."
    There is a sense that some confusion, particularly at the beginning,
    may be typical for peeragogy. With hindsight, one proposed
    "solution" would be to "have had a small group of people as a cadre
    that had met and brainstormed before the first live session [...]
    tasked [with] roles [and] on the same page".

4.  *Technological concerns.* There were quite a variety, perhaps mainly
    to do with the question: how might a (different) platform handle the
    tension between "conversations" and "content production"? For
    example, will Wordpress help us "bring in" new contributors, or
    would it be better to use an open wiki? Another respondent noted the
    utility for many readers of a take-away PDF version. The site
    (peeragogy.org) should be "[a] place for people to share, comment,
    mentor and co-learn together in an ongoing fashion."

5.  *Sample size.* Note that answers are still trickling in. How should
    we interpret the response rate? Perhaps what matters is that we are
    getting "enough" responses to make an analysis. One respondent
    proposed asking questions in a more ongoing fashion, e.g., asking
    people who are leaving: "What made you want to quit the project?"

## Discussion

> **Lisewski and Joyce**: In recent years, the tools, knowledge base and
> discourse of the learning technology profession has been bolstered by
> the appearance of conceptual paradigms such as the 'five stage

The following table helps to emphasize something we saw in the pattern
catalog: in practice, what we really have is a patchwork collection of
tricks or heuristics. The paragogy principles are themselves a
non-linear interface that we can plug into and adapt where appropriate.
Instead of a grand narrative, we see a growing collection of case
studies and descriptive patterns. As we share our experiences and make
needed adaptations, our techniques for doing peer learning and peer
production become more robust. Based on the experiences described above,
here are a few things people may want to try out in future projects:
-   "Icebreaking" techniques or a "buddy system"; continual refactoring
    into teams.
-   Maintain a process diagram that can be used to "triage" new ideas
    and effort.
-   Prefer the "good" to the "best", but make improvements at the
    platform level as needed.
-   Gathering some information from everyone who joins, and, if
    possible, everyone who leaves.

**Paragogical Principles...**
**Reflections on practice and experience suggest...**
1. *Changing context as a decentered center.* We interact by changing
the space.
1. **Develop empirical studies and a critical apparatus.***It seems we
begin with *w*eak ties, and then experience a slow formation of "peer"
relationships, as we form and re-form our social context, and come to
better understand our goals.*
2. *Meta-learning as a font of knowledge.* We interact by changing what
we know about ourselves.
2. **Find companions for the journey**. *We learn a lot about ourselves
by interacting with others. But participants struggle to find the right
way to engage:* *"co-learning", "co-teaching", or "co-producing"?
Moreover, "People come--they stay for a while, they flourish, they
build--and they go." *
3. *Peers provide feedback that wouldn’t be there otherwise.* We
interact by changing our perspective on things.
3. **Work with real users**. *We begin with a weak structure at the
outset but this may afford a more "flexible" approach as time goes on
(see also this [handbook
section](http://peeragogy.org/adding-structure-with-activities/ "Adding structure with activities")
which offers advice on designing activities that help create a "flexible
structure").*
4. *Learning is distributed and nonlinear.* We interact by changing the
way things connect.
4. **Study and build nonlinear interfaces**. *There are a number of
technological concerns, which in a large part have to do with tensions
between "content production" and "conversation", and to a lesser extent
critique the platforms we're using. *
5. *Realize the dream if you can, then wake up!* We interact by changing
our objectives.
5. **Limit philosophizing**. E*ven with a small group, we can extract
meaningful ideas about peer learning and form a strong collective
effort, which moves things forward for those involved: this means work.
We would not get the same results through "pure contemplation".*

### How we came to this decision

These Creative Commons license options were proposed by various members
of the community:
-   *CC Zero* - public domain; no restrictions for downstream users
-   *CC By-SA* - requires downstream users to include attribution and to
    license their work in the same way
-   *CC By-SA-NC* - requires downstream users to include attribution, to
    license their work in the same way and disallows any commercial use
    of the content

After a brief discussion, no one was in favor of restricting downstream
users, so we decided to go with CC0. We agreed that we would get enough
"credit" by having our names on [peeragogy.org](http://peeragogy.org/).
In connection with this discussion, we agreed that we would work on ways
to explicitly build "reusability" into the handbook content.
